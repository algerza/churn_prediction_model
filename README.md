# TODO
- EDA
- Outlier detection: descriptives and statistical approach: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nareshbhat/outlier-the-silent-killer
- Balanced dataset?
- Data cleaning
- Feature evaluation and generation
- Data splitting
- Different models and comparison
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning 
- Use cross-validation: Use cross-validation techniques like k-fold or stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure that your model is not overfitting on your imbalanced dataset.
- Model evaluation
- Model interpretation: confusion matrix, ROC curve, partial dependece plots, Shapley values
- deployment with Docker
- monitoring
- unit testing
